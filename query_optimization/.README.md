## Query Optimization & Indexing Project

This project explores the performance impact of indexing on SQL queries using synthetic data at different scales (1k â†’ 1M rows).  
It includes:

- **SQL Schema**: Table creation scripts.  
- **Python Data Generator**: Script for generating large datasets.  
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Query execution times measured with and without indexes.  
- **Analysis & Insights**:  
  - Query with the **largest slowdown** as data grew: a multi-join query (Q2).  
  - Query with the **biggest improvement** after indexing: top students by average grade (Q5).  
  - Query with **limited indexing benefit**: filtering by YEAR() function (Q1).  
  - **Trade-offs of indexing**: improved read performance, but slower inserts/updates/deletes.
